# Lotto 6 aus 49 Number Predictions with statistics and Machine Learning

Welcome to the Lotto 6 aus 49 Prediction Project! This repository contains predictive models and analyses for Lotto 6 aus 49, a popular lottery game in Germany. Through statistical analysis, machine learning models, and simulations, we aim to provide insights and predictions to help lottery enthusiasts make informed decisions.

### Features:

Statistical Analysis: Explore historical data to identify patterns and trends in lottery numbers.
Hot Numbers: Predictions based on frequently drawn numbers in previous draws.
Cold Numbers: Predictions based on numbers that have been drawn less frequently.
Longest Time not seen: Predictions based on numbers that have been absent for the longest duration.
Monte Carlo Simulation: Simulate lottery draws using random sampling techniques.
LSTM Model: Long Short-Term Memory model for sequence prediction.
Random Forest Model: Ensemble learning model for accurate predictions.

### Usage:

Explore the notebooks and scripts to understand the methodology and implementation of each predictive model.
Use the provided models to generate predictions for future Lotto 6 aus 49 draws.
Contribute to the project by improving existing models or exploring new methodologies.

If you are only interested in one specific Method then just run Notebook 1-Data_Generation.ipynb and skip to the Notebook for your desire.

Otherwise if you run each Notebook from begin to the end, i have Bonus Notebook Number 8 for you, where you can Simulate your chances of winning with this Predictions. 
However...


### DISCLAIMER:
- This is a Fun Project to Showcase some IT Skills
- Lottery is a total statistically Random Game
- Do not use or let you inspire by this Prediction!
- Gambling can make you addicted! Only Play with Caution!
- I claim no rights, that my outputs would even be near the drawn Numbers

### About the Predictions:
- Please gather some Knowledge about how Lotto 6 aus 49 work to understand the Notebooks
- The Superzahl only appears once per Lottery Ticket - we will Take 7, 5 and 4 randomly for each Ticket
- I will play 6 Fields รก 6 Numbers every Saturday and try my luck

### Remember: Lotto is a Random Game, using this Predictions may not increase your chances of winning!!! I just made this as a fun Project for myself
